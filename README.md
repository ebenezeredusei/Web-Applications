# Web-Applications for Machine learning Models

The usefulness of a machine learning model is in its accessibility to the intended users. In the case of this project, the Logistics Regression machine learning model which was applied to predicting the customer churn rate at vodafone was wrapped and used in creating an application/interface which workers of vodafone can interract with to obtain important business insight.

this includes:
The Customer_churn_App: A streamlit application script, which when launched, opens a streamlit webapplication with a simple user interface that takes customer informtion as input, and returns the chrun decision as outputs

The gradio_app: a Gradio application script, which demonstrates the documentation for creating a gradio-based web application capable of accepting customer information as inputs and returning customer churn decision as output.

The models folder: Contains the various files and models used in expot=rting the predictive model from jupyter notebook and crreating the predictive function.
